## Introduction/Background 
### Topic
Single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has generated petabytes of data detailing the transcriptomes<sup>I</sup> of billions of cells, generating insights ranging from biomarkers<sup>II</sup> of disease states to the discovery of new cell-types. Diverse methods for generating these data cause high variability in the number & similarity of cells sequenced, and mRNAs sequenced per cell<sup>[6,11,12]</sup>. Developing robust methods for sc-RNAseq analysis is critical to standardizing analytical results and expediting scientific discoveries<sup>[6,11,12]</sup>.

### Dataset & Features
Our primary dataset is a 27297x10396 array<sup>[5]</sup>. Rows indicate genes, and columns indicate mouse stem cells collected over a 7-day differentiation protocol. Entries are unique observations of mRNAs encoding gene R in cell C. Prior work has identified 5 cell-types at 3 stages of maturity in these data<sup>[3,5]</sup>.
Genes with few observations are statistically unreliable, and dead cells are a source of confounding noise. Regressing gene expression against background processes (e.g. mitosis) further reduces noise. After cleaning, typical scRNA-seq analyses focus on 100s-1000s of genes in 1000-5000 cells<sup>[6]</sup>.

## Problem Definition & Motivation
Robust methods for interpreting transcriptomic<sup>I</sup> responses to arbitrary stimuli can yield insights into disease state evolution and aid in the development of novel therapies. Diffusion Pseudotime<sup>III</sup> analysis (DPT) is a method for ordering cells along a continuous process and is robust to batch effects on sampling density and sequencing depth, making it a flexible tool for classifying cells<sup>[3]</sup>.
Our goals are: (1) identify distinct populations of cells differentiating from a common origin, and (2) determine the physiological role of those populations.

### Methods:
#### Unsupervised Subproject - Graph Inference
We obtain a graph of nearest-neighbor cells in transcriptomic<sup>I</sup> space from the unsupervised classifier <code>sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors</code>, then compute a transition matrix representing the probability of each cell transitioning into another using previously described methods<sup>[5]</sup> (see figure above). <code>scanpy.tl.dpt</code> can then derive a pseudotemporal ordering of immature cells differentiating into groups of mature cells and the mean positions in the transcriptomic<sup>I</sup> space of mature cells.
#### Supervised Subproject - Graph Annotation
We determine the physiological role of the differentiated cells by mapping their transcriptomes<sup>I</sup> to representative transcriptomes<sup>I</sup> of labeled cell-types using <code>scanpy.tl.ingest</code>, which takes in a dimensionality-reduced representation of the reference data generated with <code>scanpy.tl.umap</code>.

### Potential results and Discussion
#### Research Questions
* **RQ1.** Can we order cells along an arbitrary branching process using scRNA-seq data? 

* **RQ2.** Can we determine the identity of cells near terminal points in the above process using scRNA-seq data?

#### Quantitative Metrics 
_Unsupervised_ - We use a clustering dispersion metric (ex. Calinski-Harabasz Index) to evaluate the quality of our KNN clusters. We use kendall rank correlation<sup>[3]</sup> to compare pseudotemporal ordering of cells to the collection time of those cells. Good correlation will indicate that the transition matrix orders cells according to primarily time-driven processes.

_Supervised_ - Given the ground truths, we can employ matching-based (ex. F-measure), entropy-based (ex. Normalized mutual information), or pairwise measures (ex. Jaccard coefficient) to evaluate supervised classification.

All methods will use a Euclidean distance metric in transcriptomic<sup>I</sup> space.

## Definition of Terms
1. Transcriptome - “A transcriptome is the full range of messenger RNA, or mRNA, molecules expressed by an organism. The term ‘transcriptome’ can also be used to describe the array of mRNA transcripts produced in a particular cell or tissue type.”
2. Biomarker - A molecule whose presence is indicative of some process, e.g. the development of a disease state, or the metabolization of certain toxins.
3. Pseudotime - An abstracted notion of time or another independent variable associated with a continuous (time-dependent) process (e.g. the evolution of a system from state A to state B), which can be used to describe and order intermediate positions in that process.
